Input and Output Files
=======================
This chapter provides an overview of the input and output files needed by the components
of the UFS SRW Application (i.e., :term:`UFS_UTILS`, the UFS :term:`Weather Model`, and the :term:`UPP`). Links to more detailed documentation for each of the components are provided. For SRW App users who want to jump straight to downloading and staging the files, see :numref:`Section %s <DownloadingStagingInput>`. 

.. _Input:

Input Files
===========
The SRW Application requires numerous input files to run: static datasets (fix files
containing climatological information, terrain and land use data), initial and boundary
conditions files, and model configuration files (such as namelists).

Initial and Boundary Condition Files
------------------------------------
The external model files needed for initializing the runs can be obtained in a number of
ways, including: pulled directly from `NOMADS <https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/>`_;
limited data availability), pulled from the NOAA HPSS during the workflow execution (requires
user access), or obtained and staged by the user from a different source. The data format for
these files can be :term:`GRIB2` or :term:`NEMSIO`. More information on downloading and setting up
the external model data can be found in :numref:`Section %s <DownloadingStagingInput>`. Once the data is set up, the end-to-end application will run the system and write output files to disk.

Pre-processing (UFS_UTILS)
--------------------------
When a user runs the SRW Application as described in the Quick Start Guide :numref:`Chapter %s <QuickstartC>`, :numref:`Step %s Generate the Forecast Experiment <GenerateWorkflowC>` links the input data for the pre-processing utilities from a location on disk to the experiment directory. The pre-processing utilities use many different datasets to create grids and to generate model input datasets from the external model files. A detailed description of the input files for the pre-processing utilities can be found `here <https://noaa-emcufs-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

UFS Weather Model
-----------------
The input files for the weather model include both static (fixed) files and grid- and date-specific files (terrain, initial conditions, boundary conditions, etc). The static fix files
must be staged by the user unless you are running on a Level 1/pre-configured platform, in which case you can link to the existing copy of the data on that machine. See :numref:`Section %s <StaticFixFiles>` for more information. The static, grid, and date-specific files are linked in the experiment directory by the workflow scripts. An extensive description of the input files for the weather model can be found in the `UFS Weather Model User's Guide <https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. The namelists and configuration files for the SRW Application are created from templates by the workflow, as described in :numref:`Section %s <WorkflowTemplates>`.

Unified Post Processor (UPP)
----------------------------
Documentation for the UPP input files can be found in the `UPP User's Guide
<https://upp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html>`__.

.. _WorkflowTemplates:

Workflow
--------
The SRW Application uses a series of template files, combined with user-selected settings,
to create the required namelists and parameter files needed by the Application. These
templates can be reviewed to see what defaults are being used and where configuration parameters from the ``config.sh`` file are assigned.

List of Template Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The template files for the SRW Application are located in ``regional_workflow/ush/templates``
and are shown in :numref:`Table %s <TemplateFiles>`.

Migratory Route of the Input Files in the Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:numref:`Figure %s <MigratoryRoute>` shows how the case-specific input files in the
``ufs-srweather-app/regional_workflow/ush/templates/`` directory flow to the experiment directory. The value of ``CCPP_PHYS_SUITE`` is specified in the configuration file ``config.sh``. The template input files corresponding to ``CCPP_PHYS_SUITE``, such as ``field_table`` and ``nems_configure``, are copied to the experiment directory ``EXPTDIR``, and the namelist file of the weather model ``input.nml`` is created from the ``input.nml.FV3`` and ``FV3.input.yml`` files by running the script ``generate_FV3LAM_wflow.sh``. While running the task ``RUN_FCST`` in the regional workflow as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <WorkflowTasksFig>`, the ``field_table``, ``nems.configure``, and ``input.nml`` files, located in ``EXPTDIR``, are linked to the cycle directory ``CYCLE_DIR/``. Additionally, ``diag_table`` and ``model_configure`` are copied from the ``templates`` directory. Finally, these files are updated with the variables specified in ``var_defn.sh``.

.. _MigratoryRoute:

.. figure:: _static/FV3LAM_wflow_input_path.png

    *Migratory route of input files*

.. _OutputFiles:

Output Files
============

The location of the output files written to disk is defined by the experiment directory,
``EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH``, as set in ``config.sh``. 

Initial and boundary condition files
------------------------------------
The external model data used by ``chgres_cube`` (as part of the pre-processing utilities) are located
in the experiment run directory under ``EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH/{EXTRN_MDL_NAME_ICS/LBCS}``.

Pre-processing (UFS_UTILS)
--------------------------
The files output by the pre-processing utilities reside in the ``INPUT`` directory under the
experiment run directory ``EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH/INPUT`` and consist of the following:

* ``C403_grid.tile7.halo3.nc``
* ``gfs_bndy.tile7.000.nc``
* ``gfs_bndy.tile7.006.nc``
* ``gfs_ctrl.nc``
* ``gfs_data.nc -> gfs_data.tile7.halo0.nc``
* ``grid_spec.nc -> ../../grid/C403_mosaic.halo3.nc``
* ``grid.tile7.halo4.nc -> ../../grid/C403_grid.tile7.halo4.nc``
* ``oro_data.nc -> ../../orog/C403_oro_data.tile7.halo0.nc``
* ``sfc_data.nc -> sfc_data.tile7.halo0.nc``

These output files are used as inputs for the UFS weather model, and are described in the `Users Guide 
<https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/ufs-v2.0.0/InputsOutputs.html#grid-description-and-initial-condition-files>`__.

..
   COMMENT: Change link above (structure of "latest" is significantly different)

UFS Weather Model
-----------------
As mentioned previously, the workflow can be run in ‘community’ or ‘nco’ mode, which determines
the location and names of the output files.  In addition to this option, output can also be in
netCDF or NEMSIO format.  The output file format is set in the ``model_configure`` files using the
``output_file`` variable.  At this time, due to limitations in the post-processing component, only netCDF format output is recommended for the SRW Application.

.. note::
   In summary, the fully supported options for this release include running in ‘community’ mode with netCDF format output files.

In this case, the netCDF output files are written to the ``EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH`` directory. The bases of the file names are specified in the input file ``model_configure`` and are set to the following in the SRW Application:

* ``dynfHHH.nc``
* ``phyfHHH.nc``

Additional details may be found in the UFS Weather Model `Users Guide
<https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html#output-files>`__.


Unified Post Processor (UPP)
----------------------------
Documentation for the UPP output files can be found `here <https://upp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html>`__.

For the SRW Application, the weather model netCDF output files are written to the ``EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH/postprd`` directory and have the naming convention (file->linked to):

* ``BGRD3D_{YY}{JJJ}{hh}{mm}f{fhr}00 -> {domain}.t{cyc}z.bgrd3df{fhr}.tmXX.grib2``
* ``BGDAWP_{YY}{JJJ}{hh}{mm}f{fhr}00 -> {domain}.t{cyc}z.bgdawpf{fhr}.tmXX.grib2``

The default setting for the output file names uses ``rrfs`` for ``{domain}``.  This may be overridden by the user in the ``config.sh`` settings.

If you wish to modify the fields or levels that are output from the UPP, you will need to make modifications to file ``fv3lam.xml``, which resides in the UPP repository distributed with the UFS SRW Application. Specifically, if the code was cloned in the directory ``ufs-srweather-app``, the file will be located in ``ufs-srweather-app/src/UPP/parm``.

.. note::
   This process requires advanced knowledge of which fields can be output for the UFS Weather Model.

Use the directions in the `UPP User's Guide <https://upp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html#control-file>`__ for details on how to make modifications to the ``fv3lam.xml`` file and for remaking the flat text file that the UPP reads, which is called ``postxconfig-NT-fv3lam.txt`` (default).

Once you have created the new flat text file reflecting your changes, you will need to modify your
``config.sh`` to point the workflow to the new text file. In your ``config.sh``, set the following:

.. code-block:: console

   USE_CUSTOM_POST_CONFIG_FILE=”TRUE”
   CUSTOM_POST_CONFIG_PATH=”</path/to/custom/postxconfig-NT-fv3lam.txt>”

which tells the workflow to use the custom file located in the user-defined path. The path should include the filename. If this is set to true and the file path is not found, then an error will occur when trying to generate the SRW Application workflow.

You may then start your case workflow as usual and the UPP will use the new flat ``*.txt`` file.

.. _DownloadingStagingInput:

Downloading and Staging Input Data
==================================
A set of input files, including static (fix) data and raw initial and lateral boundary conditions (:term:`IC/LBC`'s), are needed to run the SRW Application. 

.. _StaticFixFiles:

Static Files
------------
The environment variables ``FIXgsm``, ``TOPO_DIR``, and ``SFC_CLIMO_INPUT_DIR`` indicate the path to
the directories where the static files are located. If you are on a pre-configured or configurable platform (i.e., a Level 1 or 2 platform), there is no need to stage the fixed files manually because they have been prestaged, and the paths are set in ``regional_workflow/ush/setup.sh``. On Level 3 & 4 systems, the static files can be downloaded individually or as a full tar file from the `FTP data repository <https://ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/EIB/UFS/SRW/v1p0/fix/>`__ or from `Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage <https://ufs-data.s3.amazonaws.com/public_release/ufs-srweather-app-v1.0.0/fix/fix_files.tar.gz>`__ using the ``wget`` command. Then ``tar -xf <filename>`` will extract the compressed file: 

.. code-block:: console

   wget https://ufs-data.s3.amazonaws.com/public_release/ufs-srweather-app-v1.0.0/fix/fix_files.tar.gz
   tar -xf fix_files.tar.gz

The paths to the staged files must then be set in ``config.sh``. Add the following code or alter the variable paths if they are already listed in the ``config.sh`` file:

* ``FIXgsm=/path-to/fix/fix_am``
* ``TOPO_DIR=/path-to/fix/fix_am/fix_orog``
* ``SFC_CLIMO_INPUT_DIR=/path-to/fix_am/fix/sfc_climo/``

.. _InitialConditions:

Initial Condition Formats and Source
------------------------------------
The SRW Application currently supports raw initial and lateral boundary conditions from numerous models (i.e., FV3GFS, NAM, RAP, HRRR). The data can be provided in three formats: :term:`NEMSIO`, netCDF, or :term:`GRIB2`. The SRW Application currently only supports the use of NEMSIO and netCDF input files from the GFS.

The data required to run the "out-of-the-box" SRW App case described in :numref:`Chapter %s <QuickstartC>` is already preinstalled on `Level 1 <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__ systems. Users on other systems can find the required IC/LBC data in the `FTP data repository <https://ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/EIB/UFS/SRW/v1p0/simple_test_case/gst_model_data.tar.gz>`__ or on `AWS cloud storage <https://ufs-data.s3.amazonaws.com/public_release/ufs-srweather-app-v1.0.0/ic/gst_model_data.tar.gz>`_. 

To add this data to your system, run the following commands from the ``ufs-srweather-app`` directory:

.. code-block:: console

   wget https://ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/EIB/UFS/SRW/v1p0/simple_test_case/gst_model_data.tar.gz
   tar -xf gst_model_data.tar.gz

This will extract the files and place them within a new ``model_data`` directory inside the ``ufs-srweather-app``. 

Then, the paths to ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS`` must be set in the ``config.sh`` file. 

.. code-block:: console

   cd <path/to/ufs-srweather-app/regional_workflow/ush>
   vi config.sh

Then, in ``config.sh``, set the following environment variables:

.. code-block:: console

   USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES=TRUE
   EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS=<path/to/ufs-srweather-app/model_data/FV3GFS>
   EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS=<path/to/ufs-srweather-app/model_data/FV3GFS>

These environment variables describe what :term:`IC/LBC` files to use (pre-staged files or files to be automatically pulled from the NOAA HPSS) and the location of the IC/LBC files. ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` is the directory where the initial conditions are located, and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS`` is the directory where the lateral boundary conditions are located. 

Initial and Lateral Boundary Condition Organization
---------------------------------------------------
The suggested directory structure and naming convention for the raw input files is described
below. While there is flexibility to modify these settings, this will provide the most reusability for multiple dates when using the SRW Application workflow.

For ease of reusing the ``config.sh`` for multiple dates and cycles, it is recommended to set up your raw :term:`IC/LBC` files such that it includes the model name (e.g., FV3GFS, NAM, RAP, HRRR) and ``YYYYMMDDHH``, for example: ``/path-to/model_data/FV3GFS/2019061518``. Since both initial and lateral boundary condition files are necessary, you can also include an ICS and LBCS directory. The sample IC/LBC's available at the FTP data repository are structured as follows:

* ``/path-to/model_data/MODEL/YYYYMMDDHH/ICS``
* ``/path-to/model_data/MODEL/YYYYMMDDHH/LBCS``

When files are pulled from the NOAA HPSS, the naming convention looks something like:

* FV3GFS (GRIB2): ``gfs.t{cycle}z.pgrb2.0p25.f{fhr}``
* FV3GFS (NEMSIO): 
   * ICs: ``gfs.t{cycle}z.atmanl.nemsio`` and ``gfs.t{cycle}z.sfcanl.nemsio``;
   * LBCs: ``gfs.t{cycle}z.atmf{fhr}.nemsio``
* RAP (GRIB2): ``rap.t{cycle}z.wrfprsf{fhr}.grib2``
* HRRR (GRIB2): ``hrrr.t{cycle}z.wrfprsf{fhr}.grib2``

In order to preserve the original file name, the ``f00`` files are placed in the ``ICS`` directory
and all other forecast files are placed in the ``LBCS`` directory. Then, a symbolic link of the
original files in the ``ICS/LBCS`` directory to the ``YYYYMMDDHH`` directory is suggested with
the cycle removed. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   ln -sf /path-to/model_data/RAP/2020041212/ICS/rap.t12z.wrfprsf00.grib2 /path-to/model_data/RAP/2020041212/rap.wrfprsf00.grib2

Doing this allows for the following to be set in the ``config.sh`` regardless of what cycle you are running:

.. code-block:: console

   USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES="TRUE"
   EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS="/path-to/model_data/HRRR"
   EXTRN_MDL_FILES_ICS=( "hrrr.wrfprsf00.grib2" )
   EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS="/path-to/model_data/RAP"
   EXTRN_MDL_FILES_LBCS=( "rap.wrfprsf03.grib2" "rap.wrfprsf06.grib2" )

If you choose to forgo the extra ``ICS`` and ``LBCS`` directory, you may either
rename the original files to remove the cycle or modify the ``config.sh`` to set: 

.. code-block:: console

   EXTRN_MDL_FILES_ICS=( "hrrr.t{cycle}z.wrfprsf00.grib2" )
   EXTRN_MDL_FILES_LBCS=( "rap.t{cycle}z.wrfprsf03.grib2" "rap.t{cycle}z.wrfprsf06.grib2" )

Default Initial and Lateral Boundary Conditions
-----------------------------------------------
The default initial and lateral boundary condition files are set to be a severe weather case
from 20190615 at 00 UTC. FV3GFS GRIB2 files are the default model and file format. A tar file
(``gst_model_data.tar.gz``) containing the model data for this case is available on EMC's FTP 
data repository at https://ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/EIB/UFS/SRW/v1p0/simple_test_case/. It is 
also available on Amazon Web Services (AWS) at https://ufs-data.s3.amazonaws.com/public_release/ufs-srweather-app-v1.0.0/ic/gst_model_data.tar.gz.

Running the App for Different Dates
-----------------------------------
If users want to run the SRW Application for dates other than 06-15-2019, you will need to
make a change in the case to specify the desired data. This is done by modifying the
``config.sh`` ``DATE_FIRST_CYCL``, ``DATE_LAST_CYCL``, and ``CYCL_HRS`` settings. The
forecast length can be modified by changing the ``FCST_LEN_HRS``. In addition, the lateral
boundary interval can be specified using the ``LBC_SPEC_INTVL_HRS`` variable.

Users will need to ensure that the initial and lateral boundary condition files are available
in the specified path for their new date, cycle, and forecast length.

Staging Initial Conditions Manually
-----------------------------------
If users want to run the SRW Application with raw model files for dates other than what
are currently available on the preconfigured platforms, they need to stage the data manually.
The data should be placed in ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS``. The path to these variables can be set in the ``config.sh`` file. Raw model files are available from a number of sources. A few examples are provided here for convenience.

Coexistence of Multiple Files for the Same Date
-----------------------------------------------
If you would like to have multiple file formats (e.g., GRIB2, NEMSIO, netCDF) for the same date
it is recommended to have a separate directory for each file format. For example, if you have GFS
GRIB2 and NEMSIO files your directory structure might look like:

.. code-block:: console

   /path-to/model_data/FV3GFS/YYYYMMDDHH/ICS and LBCS
   /path-to/model_data/FV3GFS_nemsio/YYYYMMDDHH/ICS and LBCS

If you want to use GRIB2 format files for FV3GFS you must also set additional environment
variables, including:

.. code-block:: console

   FV3GFS_FILE_FMT_ICS="grib2"
   FV3GFS_FILE_FMT_LBCS="grib2"

This is ONLY necessary if you are using FV3GFS GRIB2 files. These settings may be removed if you
are initializing from NEMSIO format FV3GFS files.

Best Practices for Conserving Disk Space and Keeping Files Safe
---------------------------------------------------------------
Initial and lateral boundary condition files are large and can occupy a significant amount of
disk space. If various users will employ a common file system to conduct runs, it is recommended
that the users share the same ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS``
directories. That way, if raw model input files are already on disk for a given date they do not
need to be replicated.

The files in the subdirectories of the ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS`` directories should be write-protected.
