   CCPP
      The `Common Community Physics Package <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp>`_ is a forecast-model agnostic, vetted collection of codes containing atmospheric physical parameterizations and suites of parameterizations for use in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) along with a framework that connects the physics to the host forecast model.

   Component
      A software element that has a clear function and interface. In Earth system models, components are often single portions of the Earth system (e.g. atmosphere, ocean, or land surface) that are assembled to form a whole.

   Component Repository
      A :term:`repository` that contains, at a minimum, source code for a single component.

   Container
      `Docker <https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`__ describes a container as "a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another."

   CONUS
      Continental United States

   chgres_cube
       The preprocessing software used to create initial and boundary condition files to 
       “coldstart” the forecast model.

   dynamical core
      Global atmospheric model based on fluid dynamics principles, including Euler's equations of motion.

   EPIC
      EPIC stands for the `Earth Prediction Innovation Center <https://epic.noaa.gov/>`__. EPIC seeks to accelerate scientific research and modeling contributions through continuous and sustained community engagement to produce the most accurate and reliable operational modeling system in the world. 

   FV3
      The Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere dynamical core (dycore). Developed at NOAA's Geophysical 
      Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), it is a scalable and flexible dycore capable of both 
      hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic atmospheric simulations.  It is the dycore used in the 
      UFS Weather Model.

   GFS
      `Global Forecast System <https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast>`_. The GFS is a National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) weather forecast model that generates data for dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables, including temperatures, winds, precipitation, soil moisture, and atmospheric ozone concentration. The system couples four separate models (atmosphere, ocean model, land/soil model, and sea ice) that work together to accurately depict weather conditions.

   GRIB2 
      The second version of the World Meterological Organization's (WMO) standard for distributing gridded data.  

   HPC-Stack
      The `HPC-Stack <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/hpc-stack>`__ is a repository that provides a unified, shell script-based build system for building the software stack required for numerical weather prediction (NWP) tools such as the `Unified Forecast System (UFS) <https://ufscommunity.org/>`__ and the `Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) <https://jointcenterforsatellitedataassimilation-jedi-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`__ framework.

   HRRR
      `High Resolution Rapid Refresh <https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/>`__. The HRRR is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh.

   IC/LBC
      Initial conditions/lateral boundary conditions

   LAM
      Limited Area Model, formerly known as the "Stand-Alone Regional Model," or SAR. LAM grids use a regional (rather than global) configuration of the FV3 dynamical core. 

   LBC
      Lateral boundary conditions.

   MPI
      MPI stands for Message Passing Interface. An MPI is a standardized communication system used in parallel programming. It establishes portable and efficient syntax for the exchange of messages and data between multiple processors that are used by a single computer program. An MPI is required for high-performance computing (HPC).

   NAM
      `North American Mesoscale Forecast System <https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/north-american-mesoscale>`_. NAM generates multiple grids (or domains) of weather forecasts over the North American continent at various horizontal resolutions. Each grid contains data for dozens of weather parameters, including temperature, precipitation, lightning, and turbulent kinetic energy. NAM uses additional numerical weather models to generate high-resolution forecasts over fixed regions, and occasionally to follow significant weather events like hurricanes.

   NCEP
      National Centers for Environmental Prediction, an arm of the National Weather Service,
      consisting of nine centers. More information can be found at https://www.ncep.noaa.gov.

   NCEPLIBS
      The software libraries created and maintained by :term:`NCEP` that are required for running 
      :term:`chgres_cube`, the UFS Weather Model, and :term:`UPP`. They are included in the `HPC-Stack <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/hpc-stack>`__. 

   NCEPLIBS-external
      A collection of third-party libraries required to build :term:`NCEPLIBS`, :term:`chgres_cube`,

   NCL
      An interpreted programming language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and 
      visualization. Stands for NCAR Command Language. More information can be found at https://www.ncl.ucar.edu.

      A central location in which files (e.g., data, code, documentation) are stored and managed. 

   UFS
      The Unified Forecast System is a community-based, coupled comprehensive Earth modeling 
      system consisting of several applications (apps). These apps span regional to global 
      domains and sub-hourly to seasonal time scales. The UFS is designed to support the Weather 
      Enterprise and to be the source system for NOAA's operational numerical weather prediction 
      applications.  More information can be found at http://ufs-dev.rap.ucar.edu/index.html.

   UFS_UTILS
      A collection of codes used by multiple :term:`UFS` apps (e.g. the UFS Short-Range Weather App,
      the UFS Medium-Range Weather App). The grid, orography, surface climatology, and initial 
      and boundary condition generation codes used by the UFS Short-Range Weather App are all 
      part of this collection.

   Umbrella repository
      A repository that houses external code, or “externals,” from additional repositories.

      operational forecasts. It can be an atmosphere-only model or an atmospheric
      model coupled with one or more additional components, such as a wave or ocean model.
