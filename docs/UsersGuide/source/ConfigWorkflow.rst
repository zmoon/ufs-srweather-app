.. _ConfigWorkflow:

==================================================================
Configuring the Workflow: ``config.sh`` and ``config_defaults.sh``		
==================================================================
To create the experiment directory and workflow when running the SRW App, the user must create an experiment configuration file named ``config.sh``.  This file contains experiment-specific information, such as dates, external model data, directories, and other relevant settings.  To help the user, two sample configuration files have been included in the ``regional_workflow`` repository’s ``ush`` directory: ``config.community.sh`` and ``config.nco.sh``.  The first is for running experiments in community mode (``RUN_ENVIR`` set to “community”; see below), and the second is for running experiments in “nco” mode (``RUN_ENVIR`` set to “nco”).  Note that for this release, only “community” mode is supported.  These files can be used as the starting point from which to generate a variety of experiment configurations in which to run the SRW App.

There is an extensive list of experiment parameters that a user can set when configuring the experiment.  Not all of these need to be explicitly set by the user in ``config.sh``.  In the case that a user does not define an entry in the ``config.sh`` script, either its value in ``config_defaults.sh`` will be used, or it will be reset depending on other parameters, e.g. the platform on which the experiment will be run (specified by ``MACHINE``). Note that ``config_defaults.sh`` contains the full list of experiment parameters that a user may set in ``config.sh`` (i.e. the user cannot set parameters in config.sh that are not initialized in ``config_defaults.sh``).

The following is a list of the parameters in the ``config_defaults.sh`` file.  For each parameter, the default value and a brief description is given.  In addition, any relevant information on features and settings supported or unsupported in this release is specified.

Platform Environment
====================
``RUN_ENVIR``: (Default: “nco”)
   This variable determines the mode that the workflow will run in.  The user can choose between two modes: “nco” and “community.”  The “nco” mode uses a directory structure that mimics what is used in operations at NOAA/NCEP Central Operations (NCO) and by those in the NOAA/NCEP/Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) working with NCO on pre-implementation testing.  Specifics of the conventions used in “nco” mode can be found in the following WCOSS Implementation Standards document:

   | NCEP Central Operations
   | WCOSS Implementation Standards
   | April 17, 2019
   | Version 10.2.0

   Setting ``RUN_ENVIR`` to “community” will use the standard directory structure and variable naming convention and is recommended in most cases for users who are not planning to implement their code into operations at NCO.

``MACHINE``: (Default: “BIG_COMPUTER”)
   The machine (a.k.a. platform) on which the workflow will run.  Currently supported platforms include "WCOSS_DELL_P3," "HERA," "ORION," "JET," "ODIN," "CHEYENNE," "STAMPEDE,” “GAEA,” “MACOS,” and “LINUX."

``ACCOUNT``: (Default: “project_name”)
   The account under which to submit jobs to the queue on the specified ``MACHINE``.

``WORKFLOW_MANAGER``: (Default: “none”)
   The workflow manager to use (e.g. “ROCOTO”). This is set to "none" by default, but if the machine name is set to a platform that supports Rocoto, this will be overwritten and set to "ROCOTO."

``SCHED``: (Default: “”)
   The job scheduler to use (e.g. slurm) on the specified ``MACHINE``.  Set this to an empty string in order for the experiment generation script to set it automatically depending on the machine the workflow is running on.  Currently, supported schedulers include "slurm," "pbspro," "lsf," "lsfcray," and "none".

``PARTITION_DEFAULT``: (Default: “”)
   If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"), the default partition to which to submit workflow tasks.  If a task does not have a specific variable that specifies the partition to which it will be submitted (e.g. ``PARTITION_HPSS``, ``PARTITION_FCST``; see below), it will be submitted to the partition specified by this variable.  If this is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.  This is not used if ``SCHED`` is not set to "slurm."

``CLUSTERS_DEFAULT``: (Default: “”)
   If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"), the default clusters to which to submit workflow tasks.  If a task does not have a specific variable that specifies the partition to which it will be submitted (e.g. ``CLUSTERS_HPSS``, ``CLUSTERS_FCST``; see below), it will be submitted to the clusters specified by this variable.  If this is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.  This is not used if ``SCHED`` is not set to "slurm."

``QUEUE_DEFAULT``: (Default: “”)
   The default queue or QOS (if using the slurm job scheduler, where QOS is Quality of Service) to which workflow tasks are submitted.  If a task does not have a specific variable that specifies the queue to which it will be submitted (e.g. ``QUEUE_HPSS``, ``QUEUE_FCST``; see below), it will be submitted to the queue specified by this variable.  If this is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.

``PARTITION_HPSS``: (Default: “”)
   If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"), the partition to which the tasks that get or create links to external model files [which are needed to generate initial conditions (ICs) and lateral boundary conditions (LBCs)] are submitted.  If this is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.  This is not used if ``SCHED`` is not set to "slurm."

``CLUSTERS_HPSS``: (Default: “”)
   If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"), the clusters to which the tasks that get or create links to external model files [which are needed to generate initial conditions (ICs) and lateral boundary conditions (LBCs)] are submitted.  If this is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.  This is not used if ``SCHED`` is not set to "slurm."

``QUEUE_HPSS``: (Default: “”)
   The queue or QOS to which the tasks that get or create links to external model files are submitted.  If this is not set or is set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.

``PARTITION_FCST``: (Default: “”)
   If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"), the partition to which the task that runs forecasts is submitted.  If this is not set or set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.  This is not used if ``SCHED`` is not set to "slurm."

``CLUSTERS_FCST``: (Default: “”)
   If using the slurm job scheduler (i.e. if ``SCHED`` is set to "slurm"), the clusters to which the task that runs forecasts is submitted.  If this is not set or set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.  This is not used if ``SCHED`` is not set to "slurm."

``QUEUE_FCST``: (Default: “”)
   The queue or QOS to which the task that runs a forecast is submitted.  If this is not set or set to an empty string, it will be (re)set to a machine-dependent value.

Parameters for Running Without a Workflow Manager
=================================================
These settings control run commands for platforms without a workflow manager.  Values will be ignored unless ``WORKFLOW_MANAGER="none"``.

``RUN_CMD_UTILS``: (Default: "mpirun -np 1")
   The run command for pre-processing utilities (shave, orog, sfc_climo_gen, etc.).  This can be left blank for smaller domains, in which case the executables will run without MPI.

``RUN_CMD_FCST``: (Default: "mpirun -np \${PE_MEMBER01}")
   The run command for the model forecast step. This will be appended to the end of the variable definitions file ("var_defns.sh").

``RUN_CMD_POST``: (Default: "mpirun -np 1")
   The run command for post-processing (UPP). Can be left blank for smaller domains, in which case UPP will run without MPI.

Cron-Associated Parameters
==========================
``USE_CRON_TO_RELAUNCH``: (Default: “FALSE”)
   Flag that determines whether or not a line is added to the user's cron table that calls the experiment launch script every ``CRON_RELAUNCH_INTVL_MNTS`` minutes.

``CRON_RELAUNCH_INTVL_MNTS``: (Default: “03”)
   The interval (in minutes) between successive calls of the experiment launch script by a cron job to (re)launch the experiment (so that the workflow for the experiment kicks off where it left off).  This is used only if ``USE_CRON_TO_RELAUNCH`` is set to “TRUE”.

Directory Parameters
====================
``EXPT_BASEDIR``: (Default: “”)
   The base directory in which the experiment directory will be created.  If this is not specified or if it is set to an empty string, it will default to ``${HOMErrfs}/../../expt_dirs``, where ``${HOMErrfs}`` contains the full path to the ``regional_workflow`` directory.

``EXPT_SUBDIR``: (Default: “”)
   The name that the experiment directory (without the full path) will have.  The full path to the experiment directory, which will be contained in the variable ``EXPTDIR``, will be:

   .. code-block:: console

      EXPTDIR="${EXPT_BASEDIR}/${EXPT_SUBDIR}"

   This parameter cannot be left as a null string.


NCO Mode Parameters

For a cycle that starts on the date specified by YYYYMMDD and hour specified by HH (where YYYYMMDD and HH are as described above) [so that the cycle date (cdate) is given by ``cdate="${YYYYMMDD}${HH}"``], the directory in which the aforementioned files will be located is:

   .. code-block:: console

      $STMP/tmpnwprd/$RUN/$cdate

``NET, envir, RUN``:
   Variables used in forming the path to the directory that will contain the output files from the post-processor (UPP) for a given cycle (see definition of ``PTMP`` below).  These are defined in the WCOSS Implementation Standards document as follows:

   ``NET``: (Default: “rrfs”)
      Model name (first level of com directory structure)

   .. code-block:: console

      $PTMP/com/$NET/$envir/$RUN.$yyyymmdd/$hh

Pre-Processing File Separator Parameters
========================================
``DOT_OR_USCORE``: (Default: "_")

``CYCL_HRS``: (Default: ( “HH1” “HH2” ))
   An array containing the hours of the day at which to launch forecasts.  Forecasts are launched at these hours on each day from ``DATE_FIRST_CYCL`` to ``DATE_LAST_CYCL``, inclusive.  Each element of this array must be a two-digit string representing an integer that is less than or equal to 23, e.g. "00", "03", "12", "23".

Initial and Lateral Boundary Condition Generation Parameters
============================================================
``EXTRN_MDL_NAME_ICS``: (Default: “FV3GFS”)

Note that the model specified in ``EXTRN_MDL_NAME_LBCS`` must have data available at a frequency greater than or equal to that implied by ``LBC_SPEC_INTVL_HRS``.  For example, if ``LBC_SPEC_INTVL_HRS`` is set to 6, then the model must have data available at least every 6 hours.  It is up to the user to ensure that this is the case.

``FV3GFS_FILE_FMT_ICS``: (Default: “nemsio”)
   If using the FV3GFS model as the source of the ICs (i.e. if ``EXTRN_MDL_NAME_ICS`` is set to "FV3GFS"), this variable specifies the format of the model files to use when generating the ICs.

This variable is not used if ``USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES`` is set to "FALSE".
 
``EXTRN_MDL_FILES_ICS``: (Default: "ICS_file1” “ICS_file2” “...”)
   Array containing the names of the files to search for in the directory specified by ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS``.  This variable is not used if ``USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES`` is set to "FALSE".

CCPP Parameter
==============
``CCPP_PHYS_SUITE``: (Default: "FV3_GFS_v15p2")
   The CCPP (Common Community Physics Package) physics suite to use for the forecast(s).  The choice of physics suite determines the forecast model's namelist file, the diagnostics table file, the field table file, and the XML physics suite definition file that are staged in the experiment directory or the cycle directories under it.  Current supported settings for this parameter are “FV3_GFS_v15p2” and “FV3_RRFS_v1alpha”.
