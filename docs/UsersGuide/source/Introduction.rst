Introduction
==============

The Unified Forecast System (:term:`UFS`) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth modeling system. NOAA’s operational model suite for numerical weather prediction (:term:`NWP`) is quickly transitioning to the UFS from a number of different modeling systems. The UFS enables research, development, and contribution opportunities within the broader :term:`weather enterprise` (e.g. government, industry, and academia). For more information about the UFS, visit the `UFS Portal <https://ufscommunity.org/>`__.

The UFS includes `multiple applications <https://ufscommunity.org/science/aboutapps/>`__ that support different forecast durations and spatial domains. This documentation describes the UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application, which targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a limited spatial domain and on time scales from minutes to several days. The SRW Application v2.0 release includes a prognostic atmospheric model, pre- and post-processing, and a community workflow for running the system end-to-end. These components are documented within this User's Guide and supported through a `community forum <https://forums.ufscommunity.org/>`_. New and improved capabilities for this release include the addition of a verification package (METplus) for both deterministic and ensemble simulations and support for four Stochastically Perturbed Perturbation (SPP) schemes. Future work will expand the capabilities of the application to include data assimilation (DA) and a forecast restart/cycling capability. 

This documentation provides a :ref:`Quick Start Guide <QuickstartC>` for running the SRW Application in a container and a :ref:`detailed guide <BuildRunSRW>` for running the SRW App on supported platforms. It also provides an overview of the :ref:`release components <Components>` and details on how to customize or modify different portions of the workflow.

.. _ComponentsOverview: 

SRW App Components Overview 
==============================

Pre-processor Utilities and Initial Conditions
------------------------------------------------

The SRW Application includes a number of pre-processing utilities that initialize and prepare the model. Tasks include generating a regional grid along with :term:`orography` and surface climatology files for that grid. One pre-processing utility converts the raw external model data into initial and lateral boundary condition files in netCDF format. Later, these files are used as input to the atmospheric model (FV3-LAM). Additional information about the pre-processor utilities can be found in :numref:`Chapter %s <Utils>` and in the `UFS_UTILS User’s Guide <https://noaa-emcufs-utils.readthedocs.io/en/ufs-v2.0.0/>`_.


Forecast Model
-----------------

Atmospheric Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The prognostic atmospheric model in the UFS SRW Application is the Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere
(:term:`FV3`) dynamical core configured with a Limited Area Model (LAM) capability (:cite:t:`BlackEtAl2021`). The dynamical core is the computational part of a model that solves the equations of fluid motion. A User’s Guide for the UFS :term:`Weather Model` can be found `here <https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/ufs-v2.0.0/>`__. 

Common Community Physics Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Common Community Physics Package <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp>`_ (:term:`CCPP`) supports interoperable atmospheric physics and land surface model options. Atmospheric physics are a set of numerical methods describing small-scale processes such as clouds, turbulence, radiation, and their interactions. The upcoming SRW App release includes four physics suites. 

Data Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SRW App supports the use of external model data in :term:`GRIB2`, :term:`NEMSIO`, and netCDF format when generating initial and boundary conditions. The UFS Weather Model ingests initial and lateral boundary condition files produced by :term:`chgres_cube`. 


Unified Post-Processor (UPP)
--------------------------------

The `Unified Post Processor <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/unified-post-processor-upp>`__ (:term:`UPP`) processes raw output from a variety of numerical weather prediction (:term:`NWP`) models. In the SRW App, it converts data output from netCDF format to GRIB2 format. The UPP can also be used to compute a variety of useful diagnostic fields, as described in the `UPP User’s Guide <https://upp.readthedocs.io/en/upp-v9.0.0/>`_. Output from the UPP can be used with visualization, plotting, and verification packages, or for further downstream post-processing (e.g., statistical post-processing techniques).


Visualization Example
-------------------------

This SRW Application release provides Python scripts to create basic visualizations of the model output. :numref:`Chapter %s <Graphics>` contains usage information and instructions; instructions also appear at the top of the scripts. 

Build System and Workflow
----------------------------

The SRW Application has a portable CMake-based build system that packages together all the components required to build the SRW Application. Once built, users can generate a Rocoto-based workflow that will run each task in the proper sequence (see `Rocoto documentation <https://github.com/christopherwharrop/rocoto/wiki/Documentation>`__ for more on workflow management). Individual components can also be run in a stand-alone, command line fashion. 

The SRW Application allows for configuration of various elements of the workflow. For example, users can modify the parameters of the atmospheric model, such as start and end dates, duration, time step, and the physics suite used for the simulation. 

This SRW Application release has been tested on a variety of platforms widely used by researchers, including NOAA High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems (e.g. Hera, Orion), cloud environments, and generic Linux and macOS systems. Four `levels of support <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`_ have been defined for the SRW Application. Preconfigured (Level 1) systems already have the required external libraries (HPC-Stack) available in a central location. The SRW Application is expected to build and run out-of-the-box on these systems, and users can :ref:`download the SRW App code <DownloadSRWApp>` without first installing prerequisites. On other platforms, the SRW App can be :ref:`run within a container <QuickstartC>` that includes the HPC-Stack, or the required libraries will need to be installed as part of the :ref:`SRW Application build <BuildRunSRW>` process. Once these prerequisite libraries are installed, applications and models should build and run successfully. However, users may need to perform additional troubleshooting on Level 3 or 4 systems since little or no pre-release testing has been conducted on these systems.

Hierarchical Repository Structure
-----------------------------------
The :term:`umbrella repository` for the SRW Application is named ``ufs-srweather-app`` and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app. An umbrella repository is a repository that houses external code, called "externals," from additional repositories. The SRW Application includes the ``manage_externals`` tool and a configuration file called ``Externals.cfg``, which describes the external repositories associated with the SRW App umbrella repository (see :numref:`Table %s <top_level_repos>`).

The UFS Weather Model contains a number of sub-repositories, which are documented `here <https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/ufs-v2.0.0/CodeOverview.html>`__.

Note that the prerequisite libraries (including NCEP Libraries and external libraries) are not included in the UFS SRW Application repository. The `HPC-Stack <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/hpc-stack>`__ repository assembles these prerequisite libraries. The HPC-Stack has already been built on `preconfigured (Level 1) platforms <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__. However, it must be built on other systems. :numref:`Chapter %s <InstallBuildHPCstack>` contains details on installing the HPC-Stack. 


.. _TopLevelDirStructure:

Directory Structure
----------------------
The ``ufs-srweather-app`` :term:`umbrella repository` structure is determined by the ``local_path`` settings contained within the ``Externals.cfg`` file. After ``manage_externals/checkout_externals`` is run (:numref:`Step %s <CheckoutExternals>`), the specific GitHub repositories described in :numref:`Table %s <top_level_repos>` are cloned into the target subdirectories shown below. Directories that will be created as part of the build process appear in parentheses and will not be visible until after the build is complete. Some directories have been removed for brevity.

In addition, running the SRW App in *community* mode creates the ``fix_am`` and ``fix_lam`` directories in ``EXPTDIR``. The ``fix_lam`` directory is initially empty but will contain some *fix* (time-independent) files after the grid, orography, and/or surface climatology generation tasks are run.

Once the workflow is launched with the ``launch_FV3LAM_wflow.sh`` script, a log file named
``log.launch_FV3LAM_wflow`` will be created (unless it already exists) in ``EXPTDIR``. The first several workflow tasks (i.e., ``make_grid``, ``make_orog``, ``make_sfc_climo``, ``get_extrn_ics``, and ``get_extrn_lbc``) are preprocessing tasks, which result in the creation of new files and
sub-directories, described in :numref:`Table %s <CreatedByWorkflow>`.

   | YYYYMMDDHH                | This is a “cycle directory” that is updated when the first         |
   |                           | cycle-specific workflow tasks (``get_extrn_ics`` and               |
   |                           | ``get_extrn_lbcs``) are run. These tasks are launched              |
   |                           | simultaneously for each cycle in the experiment. Cycle directories |
   |                           | are created to contain cycle-specific files for each cycle that    |
   |                           | the experiment runs. If ``DATE_FIRST_CYCL`` and ``DATE_LAST_CYCL`` |
   |                           | are different, and/or if ``CYCL_HRS`` contains more than one       |
   |                           | element in the ``config.sh`` file, more than one cycle directory   |
   |                           | will be created under the experiment directory.                    |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | grid                      | Directory generated by the ``make_grid`` task to store grid files  |
   |                           | for the experiment                                                 |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | log                       | Contains log files generated by the overall workflow and by its    |
   |                           | various tasks. Look in these files to trace why a task may have    |
   |                           | failed.                                                            |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | orog                      | Directory generated by the ``make_orog`` task containing the       |
   |                           | orography files for the experiment                                 |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | sfc_climo                 | Directory generated by the ``make_sfc_climo`` task containing the  |
   |                           | surface climatology files for the experiment                       |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | FV3LAM_wflow.db           | Database files that are generated when Rocoto is called (by the    |
   | FV3LAM_wflow_lock.db      | launch script) to launch the workflow.                             |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | log.launch_FV3LAM_wflow   | The ``launch_FV3LAM_wflow.sh`` script appends its output to this   |
   |                           | log file each time it is called. Take a look at the last 30–50     |
   |                           | lines of this file to check the status of the workflow.            |

The UFS community is encouraged to contribute to the development effort of all related
utilities, model code, and infrastructure. Users can post issues in the related GitHub repositories to report bugs or to announce upcoming contributions to the code base. For code to be accepted in the authoritative repositories, users must follow the code management rules of each UFS component repository, which are outlined in the respective User's Guides listed in :numref:`Table %s <list_of_documentation>`.

Future Direction
=================

Users can expect to see incremental improvements and additional capabilities in upcoming releases of the SRW Application to enhance research opportunities and support operational forecast implementations. Planned enhancements include:

* A more extensive set of supported developmental physics suites.
* A larger number of pre-defined domains/resolutions and a *fully supported* capability to create a user-defined domain.
* Add user-defined vertical levels (number and distribution).
* Inclusion of data assimilation and forecast restart/cycling capabilities.
